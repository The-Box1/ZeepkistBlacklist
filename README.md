# Usage

In the Manage Players screen, when shift is held, the kick buttons change to ban buttons

# Removing a Blacklisted User

There is no UI to remove a blacklisted user

In the game files, under the BepInEx/config folder, there'll be a BlackListedPlayers.txt file

This file contains the user's id as well as their name at the time of banning

To view a user's current name based on id, append the user id to this URL: https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/

Any manual changes to the blacklist file require a game restart for them to take effect
